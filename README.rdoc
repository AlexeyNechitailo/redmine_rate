= Redmine Rate Plugin

The Rate plugin provides an API that can be used to find the rate for a Member of a Project at a specific date.  It also stores historical rate data so calculations will remain correct in the future.

== Features

* Track rates for a user based on
  * Date Rate came into effect and
  * the Project
* Store historic rate amounts
* Lock rates to preserve historic calculations
* Rate.for API for other plugins
* Integration with the Billing plugin
* Integration with the Budget plugin

== Getting the plugin

A copy of the plugin can be downloaded from {Little Stream Software}[https://projects.littlestreamsoftware.com/projects/redmine-rate/files] or from {GitHub}[http://github.com/edavis10/redmine_rate/tree/master]


== Installation and Setup

There are two sets of steps to install this plugin.  The first one should be done if you have used version 0.1.0 of the Budget Plugin or 0.2.0 of the Billing Plugin.  This is because the rate data needs to be migrated out of the Budget plugin and into this plugin.

=== If you have data from a previous version of Budget or Billing

These installation instructions are very specific because the Rate plugin adjusts data inside the Budget plugin so several data integrity checks are needed.
